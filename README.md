## Capstone
This is the capstone project for my bachelors degree. It is a java program developed in Intellij. The application is meant to allow an airline to analyze customer survey satisfaction data. It has graphs, charts, filtering, a descriptive algorithm and a predictive algorithm.

## Intro to AI
The counselor chatbox is the first task for this class. It is meant to take the load off a counselor by chatting with a student and providing a career suggestion. I developed it in Pandorabots. The second task is a basic search and rescue robot that uses infrared sensors to find a person hidden in the wreckage of a tsunami. I created this using coppelia robotics. 

## Data Structures and Algorithms 2
This is a python project and a variation on the travelling salesman problem. It is an application that will deliver 40 packages around Salt Lake City, UT. It essentially has 2 trucks and delivers the packages in about 139 total miles.

## Software 2
This is a java project that provides meeting scheduling and customer management. It stores and accesses the necessary information from a database using a MYSQL JDBC driver and a connection object.

## Software 1
This is a java project with a user interface. It was developed to provide an inventory management system. A GUI mockup was provided.
